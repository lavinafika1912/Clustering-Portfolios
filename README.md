********Clustering Analysis for Industrial Engineering Applications********

 **Final Project in Data Modeling and Clustering Analysis**

As an Industrial Engineering student, I undertook a project to analyze and segment data using advanced clustering techniques. This project is part of my academic exploration into data-driven decision-making methods and their application in real-world industrial problems.

**Project Overview**

This project is centered on clustering analysis with two key methods:

	1. K-Means Clustering – A partition-based method to group data points into clusters.
	2. Hierarchical Clustering – A tree-based approach to uncover hierarchical relationships within the data.
The project uses synthetic datasets representing scenarios such as customer segmentation and product categorization. By analyzing these datasets, we can gain insights into how to structure data-driven strategies in logistics, marketing, or inventory management.

**Objectives**
	1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data structure.
	2. Implement K-Means Clustering and determine optimal clusters.
	3. Utilize Hierarchical Clustering to identify relationships in the data.
	4. Compare the results of both methods and extract actionable insights.
 
**Tools and Techniques**
	1. Python: For data processing, modeling, and visualization.
	2. Jupyter Notebook: To document the process and provide reproducible results.
	3. Matplotlib & Seaborn: For static visualizations.
	4. Scipy & Sklearn: For clustering algorithms and evaluations.
 
**Challenges Addressed**
	1. Optimizing the number of clusters for K-Means using the Elbow Method.
	2. Evaluating hierarchical clusters with dendrograms and cophenetic correlation coefficients.
	3. Visualizing multi-dimensional data in 2D for effective interpretation.
